# Hardware evidence

Hardware facts are recorded before they are encoded in target or simulator
source. A simulator result confirms software behaviour against its declared
model; it does not increase confidence in the underlying silicon fact.

  choices remain governed by the DP32G030 manual.

## Accepted facts

### EVID-DP32-001 — Processor architecture and byte order

- **Fact:** the DP32G030 contains a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M0 processor. Its system
  interface supports little-endian data access.
- **Source:** DP32G030 manual sections 1.1 and 5.4.1–5.4.2, printed pages 20 and
  43–44. Section 5.1 also states that module data format is little-endian.
- **Method:** copied from the reference manual, not derived from existing
  firmware.
- **Confidence:** high for Work Package 3. The manual is internally consistent
  and agrees with Arm's Cortex-M0 vocabulary, but the mirrored document and
  target radio silicon have not been independently authenticated.
- **Permitted use:** select Rust's `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target and Renode's
  Cortex-M CPU model. No DP32G030 peripheral behaviour follows from this fact.
- **Required experiment:** inspect the emitted ELF architecture now; read the
  physical core identification through a non-destructive debug path only after
  recovery prerequisites are complete.

### EVID-DP32-002 — Program flash and data RAM ranges

- **Fact:** program flash occupies `0x0000_0000..=0x0000_FFFF` (64 KiB), and
  data RAM occupies `0x2000_0000..=0x2000_3FFF` (16 KiB).
- **Source:** DP32G030 manual table 5-1 in section 5.1, printed pages 39–40;
  section 5.2, printed page 41, independently states 64 KiB program flash and
  16 KiB data RAM.
- **Method:** copied. The inclusive end addresses and sizes agree exactly.
- **Confidence:** high for linker and minimal memory-model bounds; not yet
  confirmed on a physical UV-K5-family unit.
- **Permitted use:** define only flash and RAM regions in the linker script and
  Renode platform. Work Package 3 must not model the manual's peripheral ranges.
- **Required experiment:** statically check every allocated ELF section against
  these ranges; later compare non-destructive SWD memory reads with the map only
  after backup/recovery work is complete.

### EVID-ARM-003 — Cortex-M0 reset vectors

- **Fact:** the Cortex-M0 vector table is fixed at `0x0000_0000`. Its first word
  is the initial stack-pointer value, its second word is the Reset handler, and
  handler vectors have bit 0 set to identify Thumb code.
- **Source:** Arm DUI 0497A section 2.3.4 and figure 2-1, document pages 2-21 and
  2-22 (PDF pages 36–37).
- **Method:** copied from the Arm core guide, then combined with
  `EVID-DP32-002`, whose flash starts at the same address.
- **Confidence:** high for a Cortex-M0 model loaded without a boot remap.
- **Permitted use:** place a two-entry minimum vector table at the start of the
  image, set the initial stack pointer to the top of evidenced RAM, and let
  Renode begin through the ELF/vector-table reset path.
- **Required experiment:** inspect the first two ELF words and prove in Renode
  that execution reaches the Rust Reset handler without overriding the PC.

## Simulation-only observation contract

`DP32-003` may reserve one linker-controlled word inside the evidenced RAM and
write a fixed boot sentinel from the Reset handler. The Renode test may inspect
that word. The sentinel address and value are project test conventions, not
DP32G030 registers or claims about hardware behaviour.

## Unknowns deliberately excluded from DP32-003

- The UV-K5 bootloader's physical reset mapping, flash masking, image layout,
  and firmware packaging are not established.
- No clock, reset controller, flash controller, interrupt, UART, GPIO, display,
  keypad, BK4819, audio, or power register behaviour is accepted yet.
- The exact UV-K5-family board revision and fitted DP32G030 silicon have not
  been inspected.
- Hardware flashing remains blocked by `RISK-002`.

## Work Package 5 UI evidence boundary

`UI-005` introduces no hardware facts. `Menu`, `Back`, `Up`, `Down`, and
`Confirm` are product-level logical actions, and its display output is a
semantic enum rather than pixels or bus traffic. The `Menu+Back` boot gesture
is an AFIK workflow decision, not a claim about an existing radio key matrix.

The physical key matrix, side-key wiring, scan polarity and timing, display
controller, dimensions, bus, reset sequence, backlight, and board pins remain
unknown. A target UI adapter or peripheral simulator requires new sourced facts
and board experiments under `RISK-006` before implementation.
