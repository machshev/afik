# Risks and unknowns

## RISK-001 — DP32G030 peripheral evidence is incomplete

- **State:** open
- **Impact:** target startup beyond the architectural reset path, peripheral
  drivers, and a complete Renode model cannot be implemented responsibly.
- **Mitigation:** `DP32-003` records sourced Cortex-M0, byte-order, flash, RAM,
  and architectural reset-vector facts in `docs/hardware-evidence.md`. Those
  facts are sufficient only for a minimal CPU-and-memory Renode boot proof.
  Target startup details beyond the architectural reset path and every
  peripheral remain blocked until separately evidenced.

## RISK-002 — UV-K5 recovery and calibration backup are unverified

- **State:** open
- **Impact:** hardware flashing could brick a test radio or destroy calibration.
- **Mitigation:** do not flash hardware until a tested backup and recovery
  procedure exists.

## RISK-003 — Protocol wire format may change during bring-up

- **State:** open
- **Impact:** early programmer artifacts may become incompatible.
- **Mitigation:** negotiate protocol/storage versions and treat the Work Package
  1 format as provisional until UART and bootloader constraints are known.

## RISK-004 — Transactional durability is only logically modelled

- **State:** open
- **Impact:** candidate/commit isolation does not yet prove recovery from power
  loss on physical non-volatile media.
- **Mitigation:** `STORE-004` adds checksum and complete validation only to an
  offline logical configuration image; it deliberately does not claim physical
  durability. After physical storage is identified, separately define and
  model dual-slot headers, generations, and power-loss fault injection before
  implementing a device persistence layout.

## RISK-005 — Physical reset mapping and firmware packaging are unverified

- **State:** open
- **Impact:** an ELF that boots from address zero in the minimal Renode model is
  not evidence that a packaged image will boot safely on a UV-K5-family radio.
- **Mitigation:** Work Package 3 does not package or flash images. Establish the
  bootloader mask/remap, application region, image format, board revision, and
  non-destructive recovery procedure before any hardware deployment task.
