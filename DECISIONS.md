# Architecture decisions

Append-only decision log. Supersede earlier entries rather than editing their
meaning.

## ADR-001 — Separate host and embedded responsibilities

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- Embedded model, plan, storage, TX-policy, and protocol crates are `no_std`
  and heap-free. `radio-programmer` and `radio-sim` are host crates and may use
  allocation.
- This keeps device representations bounded while allowing richer offline
  project data and test tooling.

## ADR-002 — Fixed protocol envelope with COBS stream framing

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for milestone, wire format provisional
- Frames use a fixed header, bounded payload, CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE, COBS encoding,
  and a zero delimiter. COBS provides deterministic resynchronisation without
  requiring the transport to preserve packet boundaries.

## ADR-003 — Object-level candidate transactions

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- Writes are staged in a candidate snapshot, validated as a whole, and made
  active only by commit. Protocol commands never expose arbitrary storage
  addresses.

## ADR-004 — Simulated transport implements the programmer contract

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- The transport contract is byte-oriented `send`/`receive`. The in-memory
  transport drives the same encoded frames expected from later UART and replay
  transports.

## ADR-005 — Locked Nix flake is the primary development environment

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` provide the Rust host tools on supported NixOS
  systems; `.envrc` loads that shell through direnv. CI separately runs the
  declared Rust 1.86 minimum so the locked Nix package set may safely carry a
  newer compiler.

## ADR-006 — Negotiated maxima do not have to equal host maxima

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- A host with smaller fixed buffers may operate within a device's larger
  advertised maximum. The programmer compiler enforces both negotiated target
  limits and its own local bounds instead of rejecting a device merely because
  that device can accept larger frames or objects.

## ADR-007 — Object listing is bounded, paged, and generation-tagged

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for Work Package 2, wire format provisional
- `LIST_OBJECTS` pages use a zero-based object offset and include active
  generation, total count, echoed offset, and fixed-size object descriptors.
- Descriptors are strictly ordered by stable `(kind, ID)` key. The programmer
  rejects inconsistent generations, totals, offsets, bounds, or ordering rather
  than combining an ambiguous listing.
- Paging decouples complete listings from both the fixed frame payload and a
  device's negotiated object capacity.

## ADR-008 — Immediate duplicate requests replay one cached response

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for Work Package 2, wire format provisional
- The device caches exactly its most recent decoded request and response. An
  immediate byte-identical retry replays the response without re-executing the
  command.
- Reusing that sequence for different request bytes returns `SequenceConflict`
  without mutation or cache replacement. Older sequences outside the one-entry
  window are ordinary new requests.
- This gives synchronous transports safe response-loss retries with fixed
  memory and no unbounded replay history.

## ADR-009 — The first target image has an explicit minimum reset contract

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for `DP32-003`
- The image defines exactly the initial stack pointer and Reset vector required
  by Cortex-M0, then writes one simulation-only atomic sentinel and spins.
- The linker owns flash/RAM placement and asserts the vector size, sentinel
  position, memory bounds, and absence of `.data`/`.bss` that would require
  unimplemented runtime initialisation.
- Rust linking attributes are the only locally allowed unsafe language surface;
  there are no unsafe operations or raw hardware accesses.

## ADR-010 — Target builds are explicit and use pinned core sources

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for `DP32-003`
- The target binary requires an explicit Cargo feature so default host
  workspace formatting, linting, and tests do not attempt to link firmware.
- In the Nix shell, `tool/build-dp32g030.sh` builds `core` from the locked
  Nixpkgs Rust sources and uses the pinned unwrapped LLD. This avoids rustup
  state, unpinned downloads, and host-linker wrapper flags.
- The verifier rejects non-Arm, non-little-endian, non-Armv6-M, dynamic, or
  out-of-range ELF output before the image can be used by simulation.
