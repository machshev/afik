# Architecture decisions

Append-only decision log. Supersede earlier entries rather than editing their
meaning.

## ADR-001 — Separate host and embedded responsibilities

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- Embedded model, plan, storage, TX-policy, and protocol crates are `no_std`
  and heap-free. `radio-programmer` and `radio-sim` are host crates and may use
  allocation.
- This keeps device representations bounded while allowing richer offline
  project data and test tooling.

## ADR-002 — Fixed protocol envelope with COBS stream framing

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted for milestone, wire format provisional
- Frames use a fixed header, bounded payload, CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE, COBS encoding,
  and a zero delimiter. COBS provides deterministic resynchronisation without
  requiring the transport to preserve packet boundaries.

## ADR-003 — Object-level candidate transactions

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- Writes are staged in a candidate snapshot, validated as a whole, and made
  active only by commit. Protocol commands never expose arbitrary storage
  addresses.

## ADR-004 — Simulated transport implements the programmer contract

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- The transport contract is byte-oriented `send`/`receive`. The in-memory
  transport drives the same encoded frames expected from later UART and replay
  transports.

## ADR-005 — Locked Nix flake is the primary development environment

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` provide the Rust host tools on supported NixOS
  systems; `.envrc` loads that shell through direnv. CI separately runs the
  declared Rust 1.86 minimum so the locked Nix package set may safely carry a
  newer compiler.

## ADR-006 — Negotiated maxima do not have to equal host maxima

- **Date:** 2026-08-05
- **Status:** accepted
- A host with smaller fixed buffers may operate within a device's larger
  advertised maximum. The programmer compiler enforces both negotiated target
  limits and its own local bounds instead of rejecting a device merely because
  that device can accept larger frames or objects.
